## üìö Class Overview

| Class | Slide Deck | Description |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| 1 | [class1.pptx](./class1.pptx) | **Intro to Computers & Python**: What makes computers "dumb"? How do they use 0s and 1s? Learn what programming is and write your very first Python code (`print("Hello, world!")`). Includes fun exercises like giving step-by-step instructions to a robot. |
| 2 | [class2.pptx](./class2.pptx) | **Variables, Inputs & Logic**: Learn how to store information using variables, take input from users, and use `if/else` statements to make decisions in code. Includes mini-games and story-based logic examples to keep learning fun. |
| 3 | [class3.pptx](./class3.pptx) | **Loops & Repetition**: Discover how `for` and `while` loops help you repeat actions. Build simple animations, counting games, and patterns. Great for building step-by-step thinking. |
| 4 | [class4.pptx](./class4.pptx) | **Lists**: Store multiple items (like a shopping list or game scores) in one variable. Learn how to loop over them and find useful patterns. |
| 5 | [class5.pptx](./class5.pptx) | **Functions & Reuse**: Learn how to group code using `def`. Reuse logic, build smarter programs, and understand how to structure your code like real developers. |
