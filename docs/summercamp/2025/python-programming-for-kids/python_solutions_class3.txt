Bonus Challenge: Understanding the Code
---------------------------------------
# Code Explanation:
# The loop allows the user to enter a password up to 3 times.
# If the password is correct, it prints "Access granted!" and exits the loop using break.
# If all 3 attempts are wrong, it shows "You are locked out."

password = "python123"
for attempt in range(3):
    guess = input("Enter the password: ")
    if guess == password:
        print("🔓 Access granted!")
        break
    else:
        print("❌ Wrong password.")
else:
    print("🔒 You are locked out.")
