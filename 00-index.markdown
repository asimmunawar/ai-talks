Hi, I am **Asim Munawar**. There are 3 major motivations behind this project. 

1. My main motivation is the make the talks and high-quality powerpoint slides available as open source with a very permissive license. 
1. Some of the talks on this topic by non-experts set wrong expectations for these technologies. On the other hand, I feel, that the experts are sometimes locked in their own silos and they fail to give an unbiased view of the technology. 
1. There are very few technical talks on these topics available in Urdu/Hindi. I plan to make all the talks available in English and Urdu/Hindi language

Here is my short bio: _"Dr. Asim Munawar is a research lead for the alignment of generative AI for enterprise applications.
