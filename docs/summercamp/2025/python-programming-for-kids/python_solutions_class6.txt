📚 Python Library Homework Solutions

1. 🎲 Random Number Guess
Use the `random` library to pick a number between 1 and 10.
Ask the user to guess the number. Tell them if they’re right or wrong.

✅ Solution:
import random
secret = random.randint(1, 10)
guess = int(input("Guess a number between 1 and 10: "))
if guess == secret:
    print("🎉 Correct!")
else:
    print("❌ Wrong! The number was", secret)


2. 📏 Square Root Calculator
Import the `math` library and write a function that takes a number and prints its square root.

✅ Solution:
import math
def square_root(num):
    print("Square root is:", math.sqrt(num))
square_root(25)


3. 🎨 ASCII Art Name
Use the `art` library (pip install art) to print your name in fancy ASCII text.

✅ Solution:
!pip install art
from art import tprint
tprint("Asim")


4. 🎯 Save and Load File: My Secret Note
Write a program that asks the user to enter a secret message, then:
- Saves the message in a file called secret.txt
- Reads the message back from the file and prints it with:
  "Your secret message was: <message>"

✅ Solution:
msg = input("Enter your secret message: ")
with open("secret.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write(msg)
with open("secret.txt", "r") as f:
    content = f.read()
    print("Your secret message was:", content)


5. ⏱ Countdown Timer
Import `time` and write a loop that counts down from 5 to 1, pausing 1 second between each.

✅ Solution:
import time
for i in range(5, 0, -1):
    print(i)
    time.sleep(1)


🌟 Bonus Challenge: 📷 Image Magic
Use `cv2` (OpenCV) and `urllib` to load an image from the web and show a grayscale version of it using `matplotlib`.
(Hint: You can use the example shown in class!)

✅ Solution:
import cv2, urllib.request, numpy as np, matplotlib.pyplot as plt
url = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Fronalpstock_big.jpg"
data = np.asarray(bytearray(urllib.request.urlopen(url).read()), dtype="uint8")
img = cv2.imdecode(data, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
plt.imshow(img, cmap="gray"); plt.axis("off"); plt.title("Grayscale")
plt.show()
