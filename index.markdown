This workshop aims to explore the continued significance of Neuro-Symbolic AI
in light of the increasing dominance of foundation models and large language
models.

Neuro-symbolic AI (NSAI) is an interdisciplinary field that combines techniques from symbolic AI and neural networks to create explainable AI systems that can perform logical reasoning over the domain knowledge bases. With the recent advent of foundation models (and large-scale language models - LLMs) trained on massive amounts of data, the future of NSAI may need to be redefined. Some argue that large language models with hundreds of billions of parameters exhibit some capabilities of reasoning. However, it is not clear to what extent and how repeatable are such reasoning capabilities are? For example, Chain-of-thought prompting has been shown to misrepresent the reasons for model predictions.

We believe that the AI community is in an LLM hype cycle, and NSAI is not only more relevant than ever before, but it can also provide a solution to the limitations of today's models. We predict that NSAI will only gain more traction in the coming years as more and more industries embrace foundation models. In many cases, NSAI algorithms may need to evolve in order to work with the new AI paradigm of foundation models.

Foundation models have indeed made significant advancements in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including text generation, machine translation, question answering, and sentiment analysis. These models leverage the power of deep neural networks and massive amounts of data to learn patterns and generate text that is often coherent and contextually relevant. In many tasks, these models seem to be able to parse and generate natural language seamlessly. This is a capability that NSAI algorithms can leverage when performing symbolic manipulation in the middle. On the other end, NSAI algorithms can especially help with resolving critical limitations, such as a lack of interpretability and explainability, sensitivity to biases in training data, and difficulty in reasoning about causality and temporal dependencies.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made significant strides in recent years, with the advent of foundation models like GPT-3 and BERT, which have revolutionized natural language processing tasks. However, there is a growing need to incorporate symbolic reasoning and cognitive processes into AI systems to enable them to better understand and interpret complex real-world scenarios. This workshop aims to explore the intersection of neuro-symbolic AI and foundation models, and how this combination can advance the field of AI research and applications.


The goal of this workshop is to provide a platform for researchers to present their latest work on neuro-symbolic AI in the age of foundation models and to foster discussions on the challenges and opportunities in this area. We invite submissions of papers, posters, and demonstrations on any topic related to neuro-symbolic AI, including but not limited to:

- Survey of recent neuro-symbolic AI methods and applications
- Introduction to neuro-symbolic AI and their role in the development of the next generation of large language models
- Advances in natural language understanding and generation using Neuro-Symbolic AI
- Other applications for NSAI (time series, vision, robotics, etc.)
- Role for neuro-symbolic AI for grounded LLMs
- Learning with less data and compute with NSAI
- Ethical and social implications of Neuro-Symbolic AI in the context of large language models
- Incorporating domain knowledge in learning
- Compositional generalization
- The challenges and opportunities of combining symbolic reasoning and deep learning techniques for knowledge representation and reasoning
- Case studies and applications of Neuro-Symbolic AI in language understanding, question answering, and natural language generation
- Future directions for research and development in Neuro-Symbolic AI in the era of large language models

We welcome submissions from researchers working on related topics such as neural program synthesis, program induction, and concept learning.
