## üìö Class Overview

| Class | Slide Deck | Description |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| 1 | [class1.pptx](./class1.pptx) | **Intro to Computers & Python**: What makes computers "dumb"? How do they use 0s and 1s? Learn what programming is and write your very first Python code (`print("Hello, world!")`). Includes fun exercises like giving step-by-step instructions to a robot. |
| 2 | [class2.pptx](./class2.pptx) | **Variables, Inputs & Logic**: Learn how to store information using variables, take input from users, and use `if/else` statements to make decisions in code. Includes mini-games and story-based logic examples to keep learning fun. |
| 3 | [class3.pptx](./class3.pptx) | **Loops & Repetition**: Discover how `for` and `while` loops help you repeat actions. Build simple animations, counting games, and patterns. Great for building step-by-step thinking. |
| 4 | [class4.pptx](./class4.pptx) | **Lists**: Store multiple items (like a shopping list or game scores) in one variable. Learn how to loop over them and find useful patterns. |
| 5 | [class5.pptx](./class5.pptx) | **Functions & Reuse**: Learn how to group code using `def`. Reuse logic, build smarter programs, and understand how to structure your code like real developers. |
| 6 | [class6.pptx](./class6.pptx) | **File Handling**: Learn how to read from and write to files. Build your own note-taking or secret message saver app using text files. Understand how data lives beyond the program run. |
| 7 | [class7.pptx](./class7.pptx) | **Project Day ‚Äì Build Your App**: Kids start putting everything together to build a simple app (calculator, secret notes, flashcards, or quiz games). Focus on problem-solving and creativity. |
| 8 | [class8.pptx](./class8.pptx) | **Showcase & Review**: Final class to present projects, review key concepts, and explore next steps for curious coders. Includes a fun recap quiz and certificates of completion! |
